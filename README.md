Changelog for index.html

-Cleaned up the formatting using a plugin.

-Tested output with a screen reader to confirm it was reasonably accessible.
-Changed title to 'Horiseon'.

-Replaced all div tags with appropriate semantic tags.

-Added a role to the header to improve accessibility.  This was recommended
 to me by a plugin but it didn't seem to make a difference to the screen reader.

-Added alt tags to all the images. I didn't include alt text for the purely
 decorative images as it wouldn't improve accessibility.

-Moved the code for 'digital-market-meeting.jpg' into the html file because
 it is content.

Changelog for style.css

-Removed classes that were no longer necessary after replacing divs with
 semantic tags.
-Eliminated a bunch of redundant code.
